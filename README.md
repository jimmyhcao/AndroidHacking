Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) is a powerful open-source tool included in Kali Linux for conducting various social engineering attacks and penetration testing. One of its features is the ability to generate QR codes for Android devices to facilitate the execution of certain attacks. It's important to note that SET should only be used for ethical and legal purposes, such as testing the security of your own systems or with explicit consent from the owner.
